## Sphere Collisions

I contained three rigid spheres inside of a bigger, rigid wire sphere.
Each sphere is given a random velocity in a random direction, and my code handles all collisions between the bouncing spheres as well as between the spheres and the spherical container.

Here's how the bouncing spheres look:\

    <p>
        In all of these projects, the camera position can be adjusted using the following keys:<br>
        <b>W</b> - to move the camera forwards.<br>
        <b>S</b> - to move the camera backwards.<br>
        <b>A</b> - to move the camera clockwise around subject.<br>
        <b>D</b> - to move the camera counterclockwise around subject.<br>
        <b>I</b> - to move the camera up.<br>
        <b>K</b> - to move the camera down.
