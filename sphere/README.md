## Sphere

Triangles are the most fundamental 2-d geometric object, and can be used to build virtually any 3-d object.
In this project, I used triangles to build a sphere.

This is how the sphere looks:\

Here's how the sphere looks from the inside:\

    <p>
        In all of these projects, the camera position can be adjusted using the following keys:<br>
        <b>W</b> - to move the camera forwards.<br>
        <b>S</b> - to move the camera backwards.<br>
        <b>A</b> - to move the camera clockwise around subject.<br>
        <b>D</b> - to move the camera counterclockwise around subject.<br>
        <b>I</b> - to move the camera up.<br>
        <b>K</b> - to move the camera down.
