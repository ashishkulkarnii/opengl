### Smartphone

Here, the directory ```./image``` contains a program written in Python3 to convert an image from JPEG to a CSV file for easy parsing in C++.
Simply add an image to convert to CSV into the image directory, rename the image to ```image.jpg```, and run the code.
The result will be stored in ```image.csv```.

In case the phone's screen resolution is not high enough for your image, it can be adjusted in ```smartphone.cpp``` by changing the values of ```screenresolution``` on line 117.
